        <h1 class="h12"><center>Blog 1: Is Artificial Intelligence dangerous for us?</center></h1>
    </pre>
    <div class="div3">
    <pre  class="p">
        In modern world we are growing with technology or we can say we are depending on technology day by day. 
        Now-a-days a term come in the market called Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is a simulation of human intelligence process by machines especially computer system. As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendor have been scrambling to promote how their product and service use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.
AI programming focuses on cognitive skills that include the following:
Learning- This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn it into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.
Reasoning- This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.
Self-correction- This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.
Creativity- This aspect of AI uses neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods and other AI techniques to generate new images, new text, new music and new ideas.
As we know every things have its pros and cons. Today we are going to talk about the cons of Artificial Intelligence: 
In most of the debates tech community has said that AI (Artificial Intelligence) biggest danger for the human beings in future. In some studies done by the various intellectual persons said that AI   can overcome human beings in various fields.
•	Unemployment 
•	Social manipulation through AI algorithms
•	 Biases due to Artificial Intelligence
•	Weakening ethics and goodwill because of AI  
•	Autonomous weapons powered by artificial intelligence
•	Financial crises brought about by AI algorithms

<b>1.	Unemployment</b>- Because of Automation most of the industries are adapting Ai based technology and reducing their office staff. In most of field like marketing, manufacturing, etc. are expected that nearly 85 million job are going to be automated in between 2022 to 2025. As AI robots become smart and more dexterous the same task will require fewer humans.

<b>2.	Social manipulation through AI algorithms</b>- a 2018 report says that social manipulation as one of the top dangerous of AI (Artificial Intelligence). This fear has become a reality as politicians rely on the performance to promote their viewpoint with the recent example being Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. wielding a TikTok troll army to capture the votes of younger Filipinos during the 2022 election.

<b>3.	Biases due to Artificial Intelligence</b>- In addition to its more existential threat, Ford is focused on the way AI will adversely affect privacy and security. A prime example is China’s use of facial recognition technology in offices, schools and other venues. Besides tracking a person’s movements, the Chinese government may be able to gather enough data to monitor a person’s activities, relationships and political views.

<b>4.	Weakening ethics and goodwill because of AI</b>- Along with technologists, journalists and political figures, even religious leaders are sounding the alarm on AI’s potential socio-economic pitfalls. In a 2019 Vatican meeting titled, “The Common Good in the Digital Age,” Pope Francis warned against AI’s ability to “circulate tendentious opinions and false data” and stressed the far-reaching consequences of letting this technology develop without proper oversight or restraint.

<b>5.	Autonomous weapons powered by artificial intelligence</b>- As is too often the case, technological advancements have been harnessed for the purpose of warfare. When it comes to AI, some are keen to do something about it before it’s too late: In a 2016 open letter, over 30,000 individuals, including AI and robotics researchers, pushed back against the investment in AI-fueled autonomous weapons.

<b>6.	Financial crises brought about by AI algorithms</b>- The financial industry has become more receptive to AI technology’s involvement in everyday finance and trading processes. As a result, algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets. While AI algorithms aren’t clouded by human judgment or emotions, they also don’t take into account contexts, the interconnectedness of markets and factors like human trust and fear. These algorithms then make thousands of trades at a blistering pace with the goal of selling a few seconds later for small profits. Selling off thousands of trades could scare investors into doing the same thing, leading to sudden crashes and extreme market volatility. Instances like the 2010 Flash Crash and the Knight Capital Flash Crash serve as reminders of what could happen when trade-happy algorithms go berserk, regardless of whether rapid and massive trading is intentional.

        <h1 class="h12"><center>Blog 2: Why sports is a co-curricular activity instead of a curricular?</center></h1>
        <div class="div3">
        <pre  class="p">
            Sports have always been an essential part of human society. It is an activity that not only promotes physical fitness but also teaches valuable life skills like teamwork, leadership, perseverance, and discipline. Despite its numerous benefits, sports are still regarded as a co-curricular activity rather than a curricular one. In this blog, we will explore the reasons why sports should be considered a co-curricular activity instead of a curricular one.
Firstly, the primary purpose of schools and colleges is to impart academic knowledge to students. The curriculum is designed to teach students the necessary skills and knowledge required to excel in their chosen profession. Although sports are important, they do not directly contribute to academic achievement. Hence, it is not practical to include sports as a core part of the curriculum.
Secondly, sports require a significant amount of time and resources, which can be challenging to manage alongside academic responsibilities. Unlike academic subjects, sports require regular practice sessions, tournaments, and competitions, which can interfere with academic schedules. Thus, it is more practical to consider sports as a co-curricular activity that complements the academic curriculum.
Thirdly, sports are not mandatory for all students. Unlike academic subjects, where students are required to study and pass all subjects to progress to the next grade, sports participation is voluntary. Therefore, it would be unfair to include sports as a compulsory part of the curriculum.
Fourthly, the assessment of sports performance is subjective and can be influenced by personal biases. Academic performance is usually assessed based on objective criteria, such as test scores and assignments, which are standardized and impartial. However, sports performance is assessed by coaches and judges who may have their biases, leading to unfair evaluations. Therefore, it is better to have sports assessments conducted by experts in the field, such as sports academies, rather than schools.
Fifthly, sports require a different set of skills than academics. While academic subjects require critical thinking, problem-solving, and theoretical knowledge, sports require physical agility, coordination, and teamwork. Including sports as part of the curriculum would not only require significant changes to the academic syllabus but also the inclusion of physical education teachers with specialized training.
Lastly, sports offer unique benefits that go beyond academics. Sports promote physical fitness, mental well-being, and social skills. It teaches students the value of discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. These skills are essential for success in all areas of life, including academics, careers, and personal relationships. Therefore, it is vital to encourage sports participation among students and offer them opportunities to develop these skills.
In conclusion, sports should be considered a co-curricular activity instead of a curricular one. While academic subjects remain the primary focus of schools and colleges, sports can complement the academic curriculum by offering students unique benefits and teaching valuable life skills. By recognizing sports as a co-curricular activity, schools can provide opportunities for students to develop their physical, mental, and social abilities, leading to well-rounded individuals who are equipped to succeed in all areas of life.

        <h1 class="h12"><center>Blog 4: Life of Women in India?</center></h1>
        <div class="div3">
        <pre  class="p">
            The life of women in India is a complex and multi-layered issue, deeply rooted in the country's history, culture, and societal norms. Despite significant progress in recent years, women still face numerous challenges and barriers that prevent them from realizing their full potential and living a life of dignity and respect. In this blog, we will explore some of the key aspects of the life of women in India.
<b>Education</b>
Education is often considered the key to empowerment, and for women in India, it is especially crucial. Historically, women in India have had limited access to education, with many families prioritizing the education of their male children over their female counterparts. However, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of girls enrolling in schools and colleges. According to the National Sample Survey (NSS), the literacy rate among women in India increased from 39% in 1981 to 71% in 2011. Despite these positive developments, many challenges remain. Discrimination against girls and women in education is still prevalent, especially in rural areas where poverty and traditional gender roles continue to limit opportunities for women. Additionally, there is a significant gender gap in education, with girls dropping out of school at higher rates than boys, particularly after puberty. This is often due to the lack of separate toilets and facilities, which can make it difficult for girls to manage menstrual hygiene.
<b>Work</b>
Women's participation in the workforce in India has traditionally been low, with many women expected to prioritize their domestic responsibilities over paid employment. However, in recent years, there has been a gradual shift towards greater participation by women in the workforce, particularly in urban areas. According to the World Bank, the female labor force participation rate in India was 20.3% in 2020, up from 17.5% in 2010. Despite this progress, women still face numerous barriers to employment, including discrimination in hiring and pay, lack of access to training and education, and limited opportunities for career advancement. Additionally, women's participation in the informal sector, where wages are often lower and working conditions are more precarious, is still prevalent.
<b>Violence against women</b>
Violence against women is a pervasive and deeply ingrained problem in India. Women in India face a range of violence, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, rape, and dowry-related violence. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, there were over 400,000 cases of crimes against women reported in 2019, including over 32,000 cases of rape. Despite the introduction of laws aimed at protecting women from violence, such as the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA) and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, implementation and enforcement remain weak. Additionally, cultural attitudes towards gender roles and violence often contribute to the perpetuation of violence against women, with many incidents going unreported and unprosecuted.
<b>Health</b>
Access to healthcare is a critical issue for women in India, particularly in rural areas where healthcare infrastructure is often inadequate. Women in India face a range of health challenges, including high rates of maternal mortality, malnutrition, and reproductive health issues. According to the World Health Organization, India accounts for over 25% of global maternal deaths, with many deaths attributed to complications during childbirth and pregnancy-related infections. Additionally, many women in India lack access to family planning services and face significant barriers to accessing safe and legal abortions.
<b>Conclusion</b>
The life of women in India is complex and multifaceted, shaped by a range of factors including culture, tradition, and societal norms. While progress has been made in recent years in areas such as education and workforce participation, women still face significant challenges and barriers, particularly in areas such as violence and healthcare.

        <h1 class="h12"><center>Blog 5: Does Citizen Journalism have more impact on audience than Traditional Journalism?</center></h1>
        <div class="div3">
        <pre  class="p">
            In recent years, citizen journalism has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional journalism. With the rise of social media and other online platforms, anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection can now become a journalist and report on news events from their perspective. But does citizen journalism have more impact on the audience than traditional journalism? In this blog post, we will explore this question and examine the pros and cons of both types of journalism.
To start, let's define what we mean by citizen journalism and traditional journalism. Citizen journalism refers to the practice of non-professional individuals reporting and sharing news stories through online platforms and social media. On the other hand, traditional journalism involves professional journalists working for established media organizations like newspapers, television stations, and radio stations.
One of the main advantages of citizen journalism is its immediacy. Because citizen journalists are often eyewitnesses to events as they unfold, they can quickly report on breaking news stories before traditional journalists have even arrived on the scene. This can be especially valuable in situations like natural disasters or political protests, where time is of the essence and the public is hungry for information. Another advantage of citizen journalism is its authenticity. Because citizen journalists are often reporting from their own personal experiences and perspectives, their reporting can feel more genuine and trustworthy to audiences than traditional journalism, which can sometimes feel scripted or biased. However, there are also some disadvantages to citizen journalism. One of the main concerns is the lack of editorial oversight. Traditional journalists are held to high ethical standards and are subject to rigorous fact-checking and editing processes before their stories are published. In contrast, citizen journalists may not have the same level of training or experience, and their reporting may be more prone to errors or inaccuracies.
Another concern with citizen journalism is the potential for bias or misinformation. Because citizen journalists are often reporting on events that are close to them personally, they may be more likely to have a particular perspective or agenda that can color their reporting. In addition, social media algorithms and echo chambers can amplify and spread misinformation or rumors, making it difficult for audiences to distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources of information.

Now let's turn our attention to traditional journalism. One of the main advantages of traditional journalism is its reputation for accuracy and reliability. Established media organizations have a long history of upholding high ethical standards and conducting rigorous fact-checking and editing processes to ensure that their reporting is as accurate and unbiased as possible. This can be especially important in situations where the stakes are high, such as during elections or international crises.
Another advantage of traditional journalism is the breadth and depth of coverage. Because established media organizations have larger staffs and more resources, they can cover a wider range of topics and provide more in-depth analysis and context than individual citizen journalists.
However, traditional journalism also has some disadvantages. One of the main concerns is the potential for bias. Despite their best efforts to remain neutral and unbiased, traditional journalists are still human beings with their own personal perspectives and biases. This can sometimes result in a skewed or incomplete picture of a news story.
Another disadvantage of traditional journalism is its lack of immediacy. Because traditional journalists often have to go through lengthy fact-checking and editing processes before their stories are published, their reporting can sometimes be slower to arrive than citizen journalism. This can be frustrating for audiences who are eager for the latest news updates.
So, does citizen journalism have more impact on the audience than traditional journalism? The answer is not clear-cut. Both types of journalism have their advantages and disadvantages, and the impact they have on audiences can depend on a variety of factors, including the particular news story being reported, the audience's own biases and perspectives, and the level of trust they have in the media source. However, one thing is clear: citizen journalism has had a significant impact on the media landscape in recent years.
